2. **Grill or Fry:** Preheat a grill or heat oil in a deep fryer to 375°F (190°C). Grill or fry the boiled pork until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes per side. Remove and drain on paper towels.
3. **Prepare the Liver:** Season the chicken liver with salt and pepper. Grill or fry until cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side.

5. **Serve:** Heat a sizzling plate over medium heat and melt the butter. Transfer the pork sisig mixture onto the sizzling plate and let it sizzle for a minute. Serve hot with rice or as an appetizer.

*Note: For a creamier texture, you can add more mayonnaise according to your preference.*
